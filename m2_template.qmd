# Intro

This documents our choice of dataset for our project.

# Data card information

$\langle$ replace this with detailed information about the dataset $\rangle$

Make sure you include at least

- URL
- source (original source not repository)
- repository (e.g., HuggingFace, Kaggle, etc.)
- task you intend to use it for (e.g., question answering, summarization, etc.)
- size
- structure (e.g., train, test split)
- other information, depending on the dataset's documentation

# Data dictionary

$\langle$ replace this with a data dictionary, a table listing info about each column $\rangle$

Here's an example of a table:

-------------------------------------------------------------
 Centered   Default           Right Left
  Header    Aligned         Aligned Aligned
----------- ------- --------------- -------------------------
   First    row                12.0 Example of a row that
                                    spans multiple lines.

  Second    row                 5.0 Here's another one. Note
                                    the blank line between
                                    rows.
-------------------------------------------------------------

Table: Here's the table caption. It, too, may span
multiple lines.

*Warning: if you use the Visual editor in RStudio, it will mangle the above table.*

The data dictionary should be laid out like a table. It should include

- column name
- description
- type
- units
- example

# Addendum: Features of this file

Note: delete this section before you turn in the file!

-   Front matter
    -   Includes your name
    -   Includes the keyword "today" which resolves to the date on which you render the document
    -   Includes fonts---you should install these fonts on your computer or change the font specification to fonts you already have on your computer
    -   Includes the format (html) to which Quarto will render
    -   Includes some directives that are specific to that format: toc and embed-resources
    -   `toc` causes the table of contents to be rendered, on the right side of the frame by default
    -   `embed-resources` causes any diagrams to be included in the html file itself rather than linked---that way you can just submit the html file and I can view it instead of having to submit linked files
-   Headings: top level headings are preceded by a \# and a space; second level headings are preceded by \## and a space; you can go down several levels by increasing the number of \# symbols
-   Bulleted lists, formed by preceding the list with a blank line (or a heading) and beginning each line with a dash and a space (both are important)
-   LaTeX symbols, in this case $\langle$ and $\rangle$, which resolve to angle brackets when you render the document ... you can include any LaTeX math expressions between dollar signs or double dollar signs ... by the way, any dollar signs meant as real dollar signs should be preceded by a backslash, like \$ this, so Quarto doesn't get confused about whether you are starting an equation
-   Programmatic keywords, preceded and followed by a backtick, in this case, the name `eB.bib` bibliography file ... this causes the keyword to be rendered in a code font
-   Emphasis, by surrounding an *important* word with asterisks, causing it to be rendered in italics

Of course, you will delete all the instructions and comments in this file before you turn it in! I don't need to read them when I read your solution. The files you turn in (the qmd and the rendered html) will just include your work. These instructions and comments are just to help you get going.
